I'm Adri Katyayan.
One of the seven mountain peaks of Tirupati.
I am the second daughter of Anupam Mishra, a famous doctor and surgeon.
My mother is Amita Pandey, a famous gynecologist.
I get my name and strength from my father.
I got my courage and generosity from my mother.
Girl known by many names, Himadri.

I am Sheshadri, named after the goddess and wife of Sheshnag, king of snakes.
I was born in two thousand and two, but my birth was mourned rather than celebrated.
Our house rules are very clear.
The hierarchy depends on your contribution to the family, i.e. the number of sons you have given to the dynasty.
Even if you sacrifice your life for your mother-in-law, nobody cares.
Even if you hit your head against the walls of the house and die.
However, if you have a son, you will be rewarded.
Everyone will have ears only for you; No one can retaliate against you.
You have the right to give orders, to tell others what to do, to take place in the hierarchy.

This is a big reason why my mother was treated like a maid in my father's house.
He had no children after me.
That's why I don't get angry with my mother at all, I understand her pain.
I understand how painful it would be to be forced to touch the feet of a failure like Radhika.
and Poornima, just because they have sons.
If I were my mother, I would divorce my ignorant father no matter how many children I have.

But now I can write my own future.
I will turn the tide and break this cycle of patriarchy.
A man more powerful than me will not breathe.
I'm not going to let my stupid cousins, born with a silver spoon, crush me.
I will not abide by any of the rules that men set for women.
Gone are the days when I was a slave to their command.

I'm Adri Katyayan.
Daughter of Amita Pandey.
Aged a hundred years in a day.
I am the one who lost my innocence the day I set foot in my father's house.
No fire can burn me anymore.
For I am the fire itself.
